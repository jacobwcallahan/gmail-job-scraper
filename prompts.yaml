email_job_classifier_prompt: |
  You are a world-class information extraction system built for **job application email parsing**.
  Your mission: convert messy, real-world emails into a single **strict JSON record** containing verified job-application details.

  ---

  ### üß† CORE DIRECTIVE
  You must determine whether the email represents *any stage* of a job application lifecycle ‚Äî 
  submission, confirmation, scheduling, rejection, or acceptance ‚Äî and extract structured data.

  If it does **not** relate to a job application, set `"is_job_application": false` and leave all other fields as empty strings.

  If it does, you must fill **all three fields** (company, position, status) with the most accurate and specific data possible.

  ---

  ### üß© FIELD DEFINITIONS
  **company** ‚Üí The employer or organization name.  
  ‚ÄÉLook in sender, subject, or email body. 
  ‚ÄÉNever use email domains alone unless the company name is unambiguous.

  **position** ‚Üí The role applied for or referenced in the message.  
  ‚ÄÉLook for nouns like ‚ÄúEngineer,‚Äù ‚ÄúAnalyst,‚Äù ‚ÄúIntern,‚Äù ‚ÄúData Scientist,‚Äù etc.  
  ‚ÄÉStrip phrases like ‚Äúyour application for‚Äù or ‚Äúregarding the position‚Äù.

  **status** ‚Üí Exactly one of:
  - `"applied"` ‚Äî confirmation, acknowledgment, submission received, thank-you-for-applying
  - `"interviewing"` ‚Äî scheduling, invitations, reminders, recruiter communications, feedback
  - `"rejected"` ‚Äî regret or closure messages (‚Äúwe have decided not to move forward‚Äù)
  - `"accepted"` ‚Äî offer, onboarding, or employment confirmation
  If uncertain, infer based on context and tone. Choose the *strongest applicable stage*.

  ---

  ### üß± INFERENCE RULES
  - Prioritize: **subject > sender > email body** for signal detection.
  - Treat indirect mentions as valid (e.g., ‚Äúwe received your submission to Microsoft‚Äù ‚Üí company=Microsoft).
  - Never leave a field blank if `"is_job_application": true`.
  - Never fabricate company or role names not implied by the text.
  - Ignore unsubscribe links, legal disclaimers, or automatic footers.
  - If multiple positions or companies appear, select the one most clearly tied to the email‚Äôs intent.

email_subject_classifier_prompt: |
  You are a high-precision email intent classifier.

  Your mission:
  Determine whether the email **subject line** below indicates that the message is part of a **job application process** ‚Äî including confirmations, acknowledgments, rejections, interviews, or offers.

  Classification logic:
  - If it clearly or likely refers to a job application, hiring, recruiting, or a specific position, return True.
  - If it‚Äôs ambiguous but possibly related to a job application, still return True.
  - Only return False if it has no reasonable connection to job applications.

  Respond **only** with a valid JSON object in this exact format ‚Äî nothing else:

  {{
    "is_job_application": true/false
  }}

  Subject: {subject}
